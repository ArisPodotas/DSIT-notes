# Lesson 1

# DNA Structure and the central dogma

We approach in a data science maner

> The Cell is an autonomous system that contains a huge amount of information

Nucleus

* Keeps together the DNA The DNA is in the nucleus
* Protects from toxic material
* The nucleus makes sure the DNA can function in a safe envoiroment
* It plays a regulatory role, everything in the nucleus is non functional, it must be moved to the cytoplasm to be funcitonal
* It's seperated by a memebrane with two lipid bilayers
* Permeability of the mebrane (allows traficking in and out of hte nucleus
* Genetic infomation comes from the DNA nad moves down to the protein function

> When, Where and how to function inthe cytplasm comes from the nucleus

The idea is to create protein networks

The nucleus is mainly comprised by two types of DNA
* the compact DNA
* the loose DNA

The loose dan is ready to be transcribed
* in the image the dark is the compact non ready to transcribe

Chromatin is a super complex of DNA with proteins

In the center we have a nucleolus which makes ribosomal RNA, small particles composed of mall RNA's and proteins. It transforms RNA to protein.

* mRNA
* rRNA some have enzymatic activity, for the ribosome
* tRNA covalent with aminoacids and brings them to the ribosome
* snRNA
* microRNA

The nucleolus is the part of the nucleus that contains ribosomal chromatin, the chromatin responsible for making the ribosomal RNA for the ribosome.

Cancer cells do not need alot of things to survive. They need things for movement, division and migration.

* heterochromatic = black = non activbe = condensed = cannot transcribe
* euchromatic = light = active = can transcribe

## DNA structure

1953 - discovery

Double stranded, they are both complementary

he said that for teaching reasons so i guess a convention
* RIGHT = 5'
* LEFT = 3'

### Monomers

Monomers = nucleotide bases. mainly 4.
* ATGC

Forget chemistry our job is to understand why one contains ... and the other ... dots = sequences

* protected
* flexible
* It has a future
* variant
* versatile

TC = pyrimidines
AG = purines

#### Pairs

dyoxi - ribose

when Adenine is combined with deoxy-ribose its called dATP this is the precursor for DNA polymerisation.

The hydrolisation ot ATP leads to ADP.

ATP helps cells move around

actin is also a double helix, a polymer based on proteins. Actin is the system of the muscle function. Actin is a monomer globular protein that when combined makes a polymer, two polymers make a actin strand. Actin needs ATP to function

Last year we found another ATP function, if a protein has folded wron and you add laot of atp the protin will change back into the right shape. It will refold.

We have 20 mili-molar of atp in the cells. This alot because usually we talk about nano-molars.

* We go over the conversion table

Misfolding is very important to the cells.

Signaling = the ability of cells to transmit signals. Either inside or to other cells, this is data that we can quantify.

The most important signal in cells is phosphorilation.

GDP
GTP When it binds to some molecules it signals, when it turns to GDP it does not work anymore.

The two most common cancer mutations are:
* p53
* hRAS

This mutation allows the protein to change it's behavior, this can alter the function of other proteins rendering them oncogenic. If this mutation exist the interplay between GTP and GDP does not exist.

Phosphorilation chain normally
RAS -> RAF -> MEK -> ERK -> ELK -> cancer genes

RAS can hydrolise itself and stop the sytem. It has a binded GTP that allows it to hydrolise itself.

## Back to DNA and cemistry

He named them the Watson and Crick strands.

They interact transiaently throgh hydrogin bonds

at = 2
gc = 3

The question is why?
why 2 and 3

The DNA by iself suffers alot of stress, mechanically. It's problem is packing itself in the cells.

This is why we have 2 and 3 because the ycompliment and interact with transient bonds. As a result AT is easy to melt but GC is harder to anneal.

Every time DNA needs to bend you need flexibility and there we have lots of AT

The rigid strong sections are comprised of GC.

Watson and Crick found the B type of DNA.

We also have confimed the A and Z type and there are hypothetical mathematic models for others.

Don't forget the phosphate is negativly charged

The wet lab is dying.

We have vertical pulling forces like a spring. The DNA needs to be able to do all the movements. They are all based on the number of hydrogen bonds of the bases. The DNA is not static is oscilates every 10^-12 seconds the DNA opens and closes a little. "The DNA breaths", if you neutralise the phosphate groups the DNA stops breathing. The import of sodium form the cytoplasm controls local dna condensation.

In the b form ew have a major and minor groove, you have turns, from the first to the las tof the turn we have 10 nucleotides, each nucleotide differs 3,4 Angstron (A to the next G). So 34 Angstrom per turn.

The A form. It's more condensed, 11 bases per turn. 

Z form. We find it in areas full of GC, Asymetric, There are proteins that specifically recognize the z form.

The same sequence can have a different structure one day and some other the next, protein recognizes sequences and structures.

When the enviroment of the nucleus changes so does the shape and now we can be recognized by a protein.

They found a 3 clone dna and a 4 clone one. The 3 form will make a bridge it will not bind the whole thing, this happens in recombination.

Lots of G will conform in 4 stranded and make levers, like a cylinder Lots of potassium in the cells will stabilize this structure. There is a protein that can recognize this G quadruplex.

The DNA is dynamic, communicating with the enviroment.

    Exam question
    How many structures can we see in natrue?
    a, b, z
    quadruplex, triduplex.

After the break

### ENSEMBL system

Dalle tried to illustrate the dna in his art. DNA is the most popular molecule ever (cap).

We go over the difference of the ribos and the dioxy ribose. The phosphodiestreic bond is the one between the riboses, this is covalent and thus much more stable. 0.34 nm is 3,4 Angstrom. The data is in the middle of the sequence. We sequence both starands to make sure that there is no mistake. We can find funnt mutations this way.

AThave 11.1 Angstron the longest way, the rings 3 Angstrom, the closest part is 2.8 Angstrom

GC 2.9 smallest, 3 from the rings 10.8 in total. (All in Angstrom) 

Each of these pairs have a differenc angle as well but all thebases are in parallel

The real paper is in 3 pages.

Rosalind Franklin

Took calve DNA purified it and radiated it with electrons. Ergo the image.

## The genetic code

Table of contents

The code is a triplet.

Dont forget it works on RNA not DNA.

The genomes does not care about energy waste or time it cares about fidelity. It needs to be reliable.

If something does not happen either it is toxic or it can't happen another way. A double stranded RNA is a viral thing.

One way gene regulation happens is to make the other strand of your RNA and make it a double helix for it to be recognized by the nuclease. DICER RISK.

Why uracil?
* flecibility, plasticity
* so that it does not bind to the DNA a little

The first and the second position are the most important ones for the tRNA to bind.

He still does not answer why its singel stranded RNA with the virus thing, before viruses why was it stingle stranded?

Wobble theorey, there is a fuluctuatin in the thrids base of the codon.

Why are some pleiotropic, he said no one knows, well its mathematical and mutation minimizing. since we have 4 bases and 3 postions the combinations are 4 to the third which is 64 triplets thus the only 20 aminoacids must be pleiotropic. also this is for some of the triplets's most common mutation, to make it have the same the same aminoacid bind anyway.

It's called redundancy when the different codons code for the same aminoacid. As we go farther down into the protein structure the same shape can be made by a different sequence. 

Only methane and triptophane are the single codon aminoacids.

    Q: What is the genetic code?
    A: Redundant triplet universal

    what is wobble theorey?
    A: The third nucvleotide has less meaning than the other two.

## What is a gene

A gene is a polymer that can replicate itself under circumstance. Chemically

A gene codes for something, it contains data.

So a RNA is also a gene...

Heterogenious RNA is the precursor RNA right after transcription.

Splicing is the process of recognition of the non coding parts of a RNA and removing them, connecting the raminded back together.

Nonsence mediated RNA decay (this is the wrong name i dont remember the right one), and the why it would happen. Remember that those moelcules need to be readily available for the cell and thus it makes it and a signal can make it so that it does not decay, then its used and degraded but for that slight moment it needs the RNA asap.

> Rafail said that you could splice a RNA and keep it in the nucleus until the circumstance comes to do the same thing but now waste as much material. Look up RNA Nuclear retention.

We talk about the exporitng of proteins form the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

## Post translational modificaion

serination and others. Kinases do this attachment for phosphorus using ATP or GTP.

    Which is wrong for genetic flow informaion just write the cartoon
    Transcription -> splicing -> nuclear export -> tranlation -> folding -> post translation modification.

## Back to introns

Regulatory part of a gene At the 5' of a gene. How strong, how many transcripts in x time frame. This is the **Promoter**.

What about when the first thing is an intron.

He will ask the lariat 

    The lariat structure is the end product of the splicing of an intron

    Why do they have to circulize

    GU- A- AG

    how many nucleotides do ineed to have a shampon mechanism with the loop, what happens when it cant apply.

## 3' untranslated sequence

regulatory role.

TATTA box

ensembl example

the top strand is watson the bottom crick we choose crick 

Dominant negative effect

proteins that can dimerize and thus inactivate one another.

    He will talk about the nucleosome he said hes gonna ask us in the exams.

# Lesson 2

More on the mechanisms (not too analytical).

    I see alot of histones in the slides while hes flicking throught (maybe that was another class)

Yeah Histones

## Histones

The histone is the protein that the DNA  wraps around in the nucleus of eukaryotes that helps the packing of the DNA. The physical DNA length is 2 meters and we need to pack it in a 10 micro meter nucleus. 

The histone is positivly charged we haeb

* H2a
* H2b
* H3
* H4

In to talt we have 8 since they are all in two copies in the complex. The complex in question is the *nucleosome*. DNA does two turns around it (2 models one with a 1.8 turn and one with a 2 turn).

This complex is stable but ever more stable when the H1 histone is present. It comes and closes the complex from the outside.

It offers:
* Pompact
* Protection
* Regulation

50 billion dollars have been invested to find it's role in cancer.

We must not look over the histone tails of the complex of the nucleosome.

    Q: How are histones made since the DNA makes proteins and the histone is aprotein that wraps the DNA.
    A: They were made when the cell was by its precursor, and the precursors were made by it's precursor all the way back.

Really all such question fall back to a question of when it was first made from the abiogenetic start of life.

We do a digression into ribosimes and the first enzyme.
He says that he does not care about evolution practically but he prefers the zygote the beginning of a new life.

Back to histone tails
Each histone has a tail that protrudes out of the complex of the nucleosome. These work like a thiumb they are the gripper on the DNA.

If you leave DNA alone it has a property to make a fold around by itself. Meaning that the histone is a enzyme in a way

Now we talk about levels of density

* Naked dan 2nm 20 A
* Nucleosome, upon the 6th nucleosome the linearity becaome a hexagon and they flip flop (inter nucleosomal area) (10nm)
* Different levels can be prolongued and parallelized in the solinoid form (multiple solinoids in a linear row or line)
* these attach to the scaffold (300nm)
* The scaffold makes helxes of itself (700nm)
* Then I have a chromosome

We see a video explaining DNA condensation.

The more condensed the DNA gets the smaller the inter nucleosomal space is closed and the less the transcription can take place. The more differentiation the cell gets the less open it is.
Questions around the what nucelotides are easier to make a nucleosome. (AT)
Q: about transcription.
Q: Where does the solinoid bind to the scaffold SAR and MAR(scaffold attachment region)(Matrix attachment region)

### Regulation part of the histone lecture

Methilation adn meta transaltional changes onto the histones and the affect it has on the structure and gene regulatiuon.

Example of the K and the charge of the amino acid in the postion of the methilation or other.
HATs and DACs histone acetylation.

HDs histone deacetylation.

DAC inhihitors (trichostatin

Acetylation is a process that throught portein add acetyl gropus to histone and helps transcription to start.

For an example we do XIST  and the second X chromosome silencing

We get into the determination of these subjects because we do not like the answer that it's random.

Central subparts of hte histone complex

we can identify a central part H3, H3 + H4, H4 and the left and right parts HA + HB respectivly thus 2 of each in total.
How many parts does a nucleosome contain (central left and right)

are there sequence preferences for nucleosomes to interact with? Consider genes that are transcibed alot, they must be open all the time and their histone recognition must be lower.
Idea for the xist things - could be that the xist is produced from both but the xist rna has a set sequence andthe one that has a better match will be the one to be deactivated in one cell line and the the other is determined after it.

## Replication of DNA

We do the non lariat structure co polymerization version.

dna polymerace theta was found to have reverse transcriptase function

WE have 6
helicase
primase
singale strand binding
polymerase 3 
the one that replaces the okazaki fragment (polymerase 1)
ligase

## Transcripion (looking at mechanisma)

Transcription stages

* Initiation (crutial)
* Elongation (Easy)
* Termination (Easy)

TSS: Transcription start site

RNA polymerase 2 does not need primers, multiple proteins can wark on the same gene simultaniously (signal amplification). The only thing is the start where getting the RNA polymerase on the sequence is a little hard.

The RNA needs to be modified (splicing, polyA tail, 5'cap {methilation ofthe first base})
These modifications are very important for the half life time of the transcript.

### Promoter elemets

-25 position: TATTAA box

polymerase I II and III
I: Nucleolus and makes the rRNA
II: nucleus required for mRNA (focus)
III: tRNA ,snRNA,

Interferons and viral defense to showcase different transcription amount
Mutagen and dna repair for the purposes of showing the effect on transcription. (we use p21)

Lac Operon example

The trp operon that works the other way around
In presense of trp the operon is off

tbp tata binding protein
tf2d the larger complex of tbp
tf2a, binds on the complex
tf2b binds to that complex
the rna polymerase 2 binds
tf2f, e, h. H is the last component that starts transcription it anneals the strands and phosphorilates rna pol 2

some of these are made from tata less genes tbp is a tataless gene needs no tbp for its transcription. these genes havce a base transcription rate that if no tata activation exists it just happens slow

### Enchancers

Overactivation of transcription. Sequences that are far away from promoters that through chromatin bending will enhance transcription.

The opoposite of silencers.

and insulators.

This is a good point, there are proteins that help bind the enhancers by bending the dna in the region that will need to bend.

<hr>

Note for tomorrow - Ask about his opinion on memes and this paper https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8282340/

EMBO course last speaker is one he knows and he speaks of the virome in the microbiome. nikos kirpidis berkley.

# Lesson 3

A major problem for the cells is to tarnslate the sequence of the mrna to a transcript of protein function.

He said ribosome is a "organel" with the quotes.

## Translation

On the mrna sequence there is a complementary seqment for each aminoacitds trna tha is called the anti codon. This is for the binding of the trna onto the strand with the aminoacid. The enzyme that will add the aminoacid to the trna is called aminoacyltrnasynthetase.

    E,P, A, site on the ribosime and the order (a re ari A P E from the site where they come in so from left to right E P A) A: acceptor E: Exit P: Priming?

How does the system know that the next trna to enter the ribosome should be the one that matches the codon? Don't really know.

How it stops, the stop codon means terminate synthesis since there is no trna, a releasing factor does notice this and rf1,2,3 will recognise the stop codons and synthesis will stop. trna is releqased mrna is released.

the subunit sizes bacterial
16s 

aminoacyl trna synthetase -> proper trna -> anticodon loading -> exit

The ribosome has to be deassbmled to start transcritption
Initiator factor 1, 3 will decompose the ribosome by binding to the small subunit. The subunits release. now the mrna is ready to accomedate the rna subunits. Then for the first methionine needs to come but we have to make sure its the initiation methiodnin. This is done by a upstream sequence called the shine dalgano sequence that will signal the start methionine and not a internal one, this is for bacteria in eukaryotes its the kozack sequence and does the same thing. if2 will carry the first trna to the first atg, the first methionine has a sequence that differantiaties it form the internal one, this accomodates the first trna if2 and gtp, this loads the trna if3 gets kicked away by if2 grp will hydrolize if1 will be release nad the ribosome will be assembled. now the ribosome opens and the next trna can come do a similar structure.

eftu elongation factor helps the transfer of the next trnas in the right places and checks that the pair is matched to the codon. it comes with gtp, gtp is given to the trna, hydrolised for the binding efrs will re apply a gtp to the eftu for re cycling.

The operon does not have the ribosome de binding sequences and the ribosome will do the whole thing in one go and the stop codon will only de bind t he protein from the molecule. We have internal ribosome binding sequences.

In reality the trna is a wobbly if you acetylate the U prior to the anticodon then the third base of the anticodon will act different.

The sequence of moves that happen at the end:
* rf1 find the stop
* gtp and rf3 will be ontop of it
* one water hydrolized the aminoacid from the trna and is released
* the gtp is hydrolized and the system cannot bind
* as soon as there is no trn on the peptide if1 and if3 separate the subunits

We identify different bioinformatics problems in each lesson for us.

## JAK/STAT

Signalosome

Receptors are proteins that can interact with specificity and high affinity with cytokines (signaling molecules).

A signal molecule usually has a kinase inside the cell and upon interaction they can dimerize and activate the kinase. Usually a waterfall fo reactions takes place in the cells from the original cytokine.

When the kinases onthe receptor dimerisas it can makethe two kinases phosphorilise eachother.

The monomeric receptors on the cell membrane will be broguyth together by the recceptor moelcule and the receptors will dimerize, if each has a kinase then the kinases will come in close proximity too they can be other kinases but now they can act on eachother.

Ther eceptor itself can be phosphorilated to play a role in this.

### Architecture of a kinase

the kinase domain has a KEYY sequence in it (aminoacids) that this second tyrosine when phosphorilated itself will 50 fold the output of the kinase function.

<hr>

jak phosporilates stat that is a transcription factor.

stat has a dna binding domain and a critical tyrosine near the end that will activate the molecule upon phosphorilation.

sh2 and phosphotyrosine are motifs that like eachother.

the phosphotyrosine of one molecule of stat will interact with the sh2 of the other stat molecule

Notice how the regionality of the phosphotyrosine and the sh2 domain stops it from interacting with itself on one molecule.

The quesiton is how far do i go to find self inhibition.

This ecample path is for interferone gamma.

The stat dimer will bind dna by makinga scicor to the sequence, we see the hand example.

All the binding sequences bind on similar sequences.

    Remember the jak stat looking waterfall of reactions and the intricacy of the steps the way they look not the names

q jak2 is what -> kinase

what is stat 5 -> transctiption factor binds to dna.

jak2 dependant and jak2 independant paths

this has negative regualtion becuase socc will be a stat target gene taht will come and supress jak.

## Immunology

Overview of the immunological respose.

This is a review of the human immune system. But before he gets to the human immune system we do an overview of working with big data with an example of two papers one year apart that have completly opposite conclustion since they have interpreted the data in a different way. The second paper provides and explanation for why this might be the case. In general this does not seem like a surprising thing to him.

This lecture is split into two thematic parts

## Part A

> Note
> The immune system has an innate nad a adaptive system.

He said he considers the innate to be a more primitive version, and then he talked about the volution of these mechanisms suffic e to say i am inot satisfied with the things said becuase they bias the was he talk with a sense of superior and inferior.

The unique system that allows the adaptive sytem to be such a good system is that it has a memory sytem.

Innate immunity comes first. In a way ther begin the adaptive response that follows.

Actually he said that now with the new omics data that has been added we have better chategorization of the cells. (Becasue if you remeber the Iosinophiles were characterized by the way they will gain a color in a pigment. Suffice to say that now that we do single cell barcoding we can do the characterization better.

Now we go into the specifics of each system of immunity and not a cell overview.

the adaptive immune sytem has a $10^8$th figure fo different things it can recognize.

The innate immune system has a soffisticated way of recognizing different antigens that\s called Toll (recognization system)?

Neutrophiles are the very first line of defence.

Neuytosis is the suicide bombing of neutrophiles that spit out dna that surrounds the bacterium.

# Lesson for the immune system

The official one not the extra one that we did.

this lecture starts with the single cellular and multi cellular difference.

What is sytem biology its the model of how complex the systems and networks interact with eachoter.

The idea is that the phenotype is determined by networks and not by genes.

This sounds a little idealistic in that they want to see the whole cascade of results from a single change into the system. the quesiton is where should this start at.

First we talk aobut the innate immunity. I didnt rememer that the immune system comes from a blood stem cell aimopoitic cell.

An inflamed area will not work at all.


# Second lesson for Immune system

We are going to talk about new disorders today.

* Autoimmune dieseases and sars cov 2.
* Little bit aobut vaccines.

One of the most probminent killers is tuberculosis.

Immune evasion by viruses (hepatitis C)

h1n1 family has antigenic drift. Meaning that the replication process makes mistakes.

Antigenic shitft is when you get infected from two different viruses at the same time.
