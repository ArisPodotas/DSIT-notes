%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% FUNCTION
%  [bel, repre]=BSAS(X,theta,q,order)
% This function implements the BSAS (Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme)
% algorithm. It performs a single pass on the data. If the currently
% considered vector lies at a significant distance (greater than a given
% dissimilarity threshold) from the clusters formed so far a new cluster
% is formed represented by this vector. Otherwise the considered vector
% is assigned to its closest cluster. The results of the algorithm are 
% influenced by the order of presentation of the data.
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
%  X:       lxN matrix, each column of which corresponds to an
%           l-dimensional data vector.
%  theta:   the dissimilarity threshold.
%  q:       the maximum allowable number of clusters.
%  order:   N-dimensional vector containing a permutation of the integers
%           1,2,...,N. The i-th element of this vector specifies the order of
%           presentation of the i-th vector to the algorithm.
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
%  bel:     N-dimensional vector whose i-th element contains the
%           cluster label for the i-th data vector.
%  repre:   a matrix, each column of which contains the l-dimensional (mean) 
%           representative of each cluster.
