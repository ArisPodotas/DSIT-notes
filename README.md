# What is this?

This is a github repo for me and rafail and potentially anyone we add here for the notes from the masters at DSIT

# Naming convention

Name your notes files with the letter of your name at the start.
Or make your branch where all the files are yours and thus dont need a name for each file, it will be assumed that all files are written by you.
