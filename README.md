# What is this?

This is a github repo for me and rafail and potentially anyone we add here for the notes from the masters at DSIT

# Naming convention

Name your notes files with the letter of your name at the start.
Or make your branch where all the files are yours and thus dont need a name for each file, it will be assumed that all files are written by you.

# Writing conventions


> We use *markdown* with *LaTeX* in the documents
> Take note that the latex wont import moduels in the github document viewing section
> If you want to view the documents properly use a native compiler for *markdown* and *LaTeX*
