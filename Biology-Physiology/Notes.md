# Lesson 1

# DNA Structure and the central dogma

We approach in a data science maner

> The Cell is an autonomous system that contains a huge amount of information

Nucleus

* Keeps together the DNA The DNA is in the nucleus
* Protects from toxic material
* The nucleus makes sure the DNA can function in a safe envoiroment
* It plays a regulatory role, everything in the nucleus is non functional, it must be moved to the cytoplasm to be funcitonal
* It's seperated by a memebrane with two lipid bilayers
* Permeability of the mebrane (allows traficking in and out of hte nucleus
* Genetic infomation comes from the DNA nad moves down to the protein function

> When, Where and how to function inthe cytplasm comes from the nucleus

The idea is to create protein networks

The nucleus is mainly comprised by two types of DNA
* the compact DNA
* the loose DNA

The loose dan is ready to be transcribed
* in the image the dark is the compact non ready to transcribe

Chromatin is a super complex of DNA with proteins

In the center we have a nucleolus which makes ribosomal RNA, small particles composed of mall RNA's and proteins. It transforms RNA to protein.

* mRNA
* rRNA some have enzymatic activity, for the ribosome
* tRNA covalent with aminoacids and brings them to the ribosome
* snRNA
* microRNA

The nucleolus is the part of the nucleus that contains ribosomal chromatin, the chromatin responsible for making the ribosomal RNA for the ribosome.

Cancer cells do not need alot of things to survive. They need things for movement, division and migration.

* heterochromatic = black = non activbe = condensed = cannot transcribe
* euchromatic = light = active = can transcribe

## DNA structure

1953 - discovery

Double stranded, they are both complementary

he said that for teaching reasons so i guess a convention
* RIGHT = 5'
* LEFT = 3'

### Monomers

Monomers = nucleotide bases. mainly 4.
* ATGC

Forget chemistry our job is to understand why one contains ... and the other ... dots = sequences

* protected
* flexible
* It has a future
* variant
* versatile

TC = pyrimidines
AG = purines

#### Pars

dyoxi - ribose

when Adenine is combined with deoxy-ribose its called dATP this is the precursor for DNA polymerisation.

The hydrolisation ot ATP leads to ADP.

ATP helps cells move around

actin is also a double helix, a polymer based on proteins. Actin is the system of the muscle function. Actin is a monomer globular protein that when combined makes a polymer, two polymers make a actin strand. Actin needs ATP to function

Last year we found another ATP function, if a protein has folded wron and you add laot of atp the protin will change back into the right shape. It will refold.

We have 20 mili-molar of atp in the cells. This alot because usually we talk about nano-molars.

* We go over the conversion table

Misfolding is very important to the cells.

Signaling = the ability of cells to transmit signals. Either inside or to other cells, this is data that we can quantify.

The most important signal in cells is phosphorilation.

GDP
GTP When it binds to some molecules it signals, when it turns to GDP it does not work anymore.

The two most common cancer mutations are:
* p53
* hRAS

This mutation allows the protein to change it's behavior, this can alter the function of other proteins rendering them oncogenic. If this mutation exist the interplay between GTP and GDP does not exist.

Phosphorilation chain normally
RAS -> RAF -> MEK -> ERK -> ELK -> cancer genes

RAS can hydrolise itself and stop the sytem. It has a binded GTP that allows it to hydrolise itself.

## Back to DNA and cemistry

He named them the Watson and Crick strands.

They interact transiaently throgh hydrogin bonds

at = 2
gc = 3

The question is why?
why 2 and 3

The DNA by iself suffers alot of stress, mechanically. It's problem is packing itself in the cells.

This is why we have 2 and 3 because the ycompliment and interact with transient bonds. As a result AT is easy to melt but GC is harder to anneal.

Every time DNA needs to bend you need flexibility and there we have lots of AT

The rigid strong sections are comprised of GC.

Watson and Crick found the B type of DNA.

We also have confimed the A and Z type and there are hypothetical mathematic models for others.

Don't forget the phosphate is negativly charged

The wet lab is dying.

We have vertical pulling forces like a spring. The DNA needs to be able to do all the movements. They are all based on the number of hydrogen bonds of the bases. The DNA is not static is oscilates every 10^-12 seconds the DNA opens and closes a little. "The DNA breaths", if you neutralise the phosphate groups the DNA stops breathing. The import of sodium form the cytoplasm controls local dna condensation.

In the b form ew have a major and minor groove, you have turns, from the first to the las tof the turn we have 10 nucleotides, each nucleotide differs 3,4 Angstron (A to the next G). So 34 Angstrom per turn.

The A form. It's more condensed, 11 bases per turn. 

Z form. We find it in areas full of GC, Asymetric, There are proteins that specifically recognize the z form.

The same sequence can have a different structure one day and some other the next, protein recognizes sequences and structures.

When the enviroment of the nucleus changes so does the shape and now we can be recognized by a protein.

They found a 3 clone dna and a 4 clone one. The 3 form will make a bridge it will not bind the whole thing, this happens in recombination.

Lots of G will conform in 4 stranded and make levers, like a cylinder Lots of potassium in the cells will stabilize this structure. There is a protein that can recognize this G quadruplex.

The DNA is dynamic, communicating with the enviroment.

    Exam question
    How many structures can we see in natrue?
    a, b, z
    quadruplex, triduplex.

After the break

### ENSEMBLE system

Dalle tried to illustrate the dna in his art. DNA is the most popular molecule ever (cap).

We go over the difference of the ribos and the dioxy ribose. The phosphodiestreic bond is the one between the riboses, this is covalent and thus much more stable. 0.34 nm is 3,4 Angstrom. The data is in the middle of the sequence. We sequence both starands to make sure that there is no mistake. We can find funnt mutations this way.

AThave 11.1 Angstron the longest way, the rings 3 Angstrom, the closest part is 2.8 Angstrom

GC 2.9 smallest, 3 from the rings 10.8 in total. (All in Angstrom) 

Each of these pairs have a differenc angle as well but all thebases are in parallel

The real paper is in 3 pages.

Rosalind Franklin

Took calve DNA purified it and radiated it with electrons. Ergo the image.

## The genetic code

Table of contents

The code is a triplet.

Dont forget it works on RNA not DNA.

The genomes does not care about energy waste or time it cares about fidelity. It needs to be reliable.

If something does not happen either it is toxic or it can't happen another way. A double stranded RNA is a viral thing.

One way gene regulation happens is to make the other strand of your RNA and make it a double helix for it to be recognized by the nuclease. DICER RISK.

Why uracil?
* flecibility, plasticity
* so that it does not bind to the DNA a little

The first and the second position are the most important ones for the tRNA to bind.

He still does not answer why its singel stranded RNA with the virus thing, before viruses why was it stingle stranded?

Wobble theorey, there is a fuluctuatin in the thrids base of the codon.

Why are some pleiotropic, he said no one knows, well its mathematical and mutation minimizing. since we have 4 bases and 3 postions the combinations are 4 to the third which is 64 triplets thus the only 20 aminoacids must be pleiotropic. also this is for some of the triplets's most common mutation, to make it have the same the same aminoacid bind anyway.

It's called redundancy when the different codons code for the same aminoacid. As we go farther down into the protein structure the same shape can be made by a different sequence. 

Only methane and triptophane are the single codon aminoacids.

    Q: What is the genetic code?
    A: Redundant triplet universal

    what is wobble theorey?
    A: The third nucvleotide has less meaning than the other two.

## What is a gene

A gene is a polymer that can replicate itself under circumstance. Chemically

A gene codes for something, it contains data.

So a RNA is also a gene...

Heterogenious RNA is the precursor RNA right after transcription.

Splicing is the process of recognition of the non coding parts of a RNA and removing them, connecting the raminded back together.

Nonsence mediated RNA decay (this is the wrong name i dont remember the right one), and the why it would happen. Remember that those moelcules need to be readily available for the cell and thus it makes it and a signal can make it so that it does not decay, then its used and degraded but for that slight moment it needs the RNA asap.

> Rafail said that you could splice a RNA and keep it in the nucleus until the circumstance comes to do the same thing but now waste as much material. Look up RNA Nuclear retention.

We talk about the exporitng of proteins form the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

## Post translational modificaion

serination and others. Kinases do this attachment for phosphorus using ATP or GTP.

    Which is wrong for genetic flow informaion just write the cartoon
    Transcription -> splicing -> nuclear export -> tranlation -> folding -> post translation modification.

## Back to introns

Regulatory part of a gene At the 5' of a gene. How strong, how many transcripts in x time frame. This is the **Promoter**.

What about when the first thing is an intron.

He will ask the lariat 

    The lariat structure is the end product of the splicing of an intron

    Why do they have to circulize

    GU- A- AG

    how many nucleotides do ineed to have a shampon mechanism with the loop, what happens when it cant apply.

## 3' untranslated sequence

regulatory role.

TATTA box

ensembl example

the top strand is watson the bottom crick we choose crick 

Dominant negative effect

proteins that can dimerize and thus inactivate one another.


    He will talk about the nucleosome he said hes gonna aks u inthe exams.
