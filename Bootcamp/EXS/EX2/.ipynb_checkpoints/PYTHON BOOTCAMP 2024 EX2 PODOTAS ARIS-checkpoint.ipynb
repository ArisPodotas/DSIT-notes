    " The Levenshtein distance is a metric that measures string similarity by counting the minimum number of single-character edits required to transform one string into another. These edits can include insertions, deletions, or substitutions of characters. For example, the Levenshtein distance between \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" is 3 because we need to substitute 'k' with 's', change 'e' to 'i', and insert 'g' at the end.\n",
