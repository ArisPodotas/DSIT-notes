Python is slow because it needs an interpreter
Python is dynamically typed, data type doesnâ€™t need to be declared beforehand
Disatvantadges:
In large projects it is difficult to handle the datatypes 
It guesses the datatype which takes time
The memory to be reserved for the variable is unknown , it makes an estimate and that takes time
del + variable deletes the value of the variable
NEVER USE BREAK OR CONTINUE (disrupts the logic flow)
Factorial
For I in range(1,n+1) result *= I Factorial
file.Write overwrites from the start, file.append adds to the end
Filehandler is the name of the file. It is contained in the file variable and it is returned by the open function
LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE , minimum distance for a string to be converted to another
