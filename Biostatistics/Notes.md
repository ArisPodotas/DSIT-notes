# Lesson 1

He gave us a panphlet to read the lecture in case we dont have a laptop to keep notes during the lesson. He uploads the lessons on e-class.

Same for ever first lesson

> Examination
> 
> Usually if the sturdents do a set of exercises during the year the first (first 3 month) and the second second 3 months
> There is no final exam
> He asked us if we want to give a final exam and he is willign to do it at the end anyway.

The lesson the course is consistant of 13 lessons, they are more introductory at the start that dont know any statistics from the past the second partis more advanced. They found it interesting in the past that it fills some gaps from other lessons inthe course. He is available for any question not just his statistics.

Syllabus question
> The slides are the only thing you need they give the appropriate information.
> We will cover
>> Introduction
>> Hypothesis test of a mean value, variance and the non parametric hypothesis testing
>> Two variable cases, linear regression with one and multi parametric
>> Corralation analysis
>> Logistic regression
>> Non linear regression cases
>> Method of the principal component analysis, discriminational analysis
>> Analysis of variance with one and multi variant case
>> Survival analysis

We will not prove these methods we will apply the methods on biomedical data
He wants us to know how to apply these methods on real data in our hands.

We use MATLAB, you use every package you know

The questions is a problem with data and you come up with a small code and report for the data. Not too mathematical.

This is a course with applications.

Teacher background, physics at athens - masters in it - phd in it

## Start

He literally does the panphlet

example on the not for 2. 1 statistical populaiton

> [!NOTE]
> A population that took a drug when theyu did not


### Example on 2.

Definitons 
    Sample
    he drew on the table to show the sample

Sampling methods
Probability sampling is when everyone is within reach and has the same probability to be part of the sample
Non probability sampling is when some individuals are un reachable thus you cant generalize since you have bias
Sometimes you can have a error correction for bias but there is the case with not error correction method for you.
